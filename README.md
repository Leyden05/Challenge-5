# Challenge-5
In Challenge 5, we were assigned to make a scheduling tool that allows users to save their input data using local storage. This scheduling tool also allows users to gauge the current time using an API called 'day.js'. In this specific instance, the page loads with an error of all of the blocks being set to present, however, the user is still able to save information and gauge the time of day.
